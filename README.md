**Multilingual Wordle** is a unique, language-flexible word game inspired by the classic Wordle — but it's not just a clone. It takes the idea of word-guessing and transforms it into something new and challenging.

Instead of guessing just one fixed-length word, each round can include:
- **Two words** to guess instead of one
- **Random word lengths** to make things unpredictable

And here's the twist: you play the entire game in the language you choose!

## 🌍 Supported Languages

- 🇯🇵 **Japanese** (日本語)
- 🇹🇷 **Turkish** (Türkçe)
- 🇬🇧 **English**

Choose your language from the top corner and enjoy the full game experience in that language only.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Select your preferred language from the top-right corner.
- Type your guesses — feedback will help you find the correct words.
- Use logic and vocabulary knowledge to solve the puzzle.
- Each game may have different rules: double words or unpredictable word lengths!

## ✨ Features

- Three fully supported languages: Turkish, English, and Japanese
